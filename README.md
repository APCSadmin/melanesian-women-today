Hello fellow APCS students. Welcome to the grid.

If you are reading this file, you should be connected to our repository already. If this is the case, from your account,
follow the guide for contributing to a repository. We will take all your files and make the magic happen.

If you are not an APCS student, how did you get here? This is awkward. Our code is open source and free to use, but we
will probably not be using your contributions to make the magic happen.

That's all for now. Get to work.
